            "When I look into your eyes
            I can see a love restrained
            But darlin' when I hold you
            Don't you know I feel the same?
            Nothin' lasts forever
            And we both know hearts can change
            And it's hard to hold a candle
            In the cold November rain
            We've been through this such a long long time
            Just tryin' to kill the pain, ooh yeah
            Love is always coming, love is always going
            No one's really sure who's lettin' go today
            Walking away
            If we could take the time to lay it on the line
            I could rest my head just knowin' that you were mine
            All mine
            So if you want to love me then darlin' don't refrain
            Or I'll just end up walkin' in the cold November rain
            Do you need some time on your own?
            Do you need some time all alone?
            Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
            Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone
            I know it's hard to keep an open heart
            When even friends seem out to harm you
            But if you could heal a broken heart
            Wouldn't time be out to charm you?
            Oh, oh, oh
            Sometimes I need some time on my own
            Sometimes I need some time all alone
            Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
            Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone
            And when your fears subside
            And shadows still remain, oh yeah
            I know that you can love me when there's no one left to blame
            So never mind the darkness, we still can find a way
            'Cause nothin' lasts forever, even cold November rain
            Don't ya think that you need somebody?
            Don't ya think that you need someone?
            Everybody needs somebody
            You're not the only one
            You're not the only one
            Don't ya think that you need somebody?
            Don't ya think that you need someone?

            "Carry on my wayward son
            There'll be peace when you are done
            Lay your weary head to rest
            Don't you cry no more
            Once I rose above the noise and confusion
            Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
            I was soaring ever higher
            But I flew too high
            Though my eyes could see, I still was a blind man
            Though my mind could think, I still was a mad man
            I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
            I can hear them say
            Carry on, my wayward son
            There'll be peace when you are done
            Lay your weary head to rest
            Don't you cry no more
            Masquerading as a man with a reason
            My charade is the event of the season
            And if I claim to be a wise man, well
            It surely means that I don't know
            On a stormy sea of moving emotion
            Tossed about, I'm like a ship on the ocean
            I set a course for winds of fortune
            But I hear the voices say
            Carry on, my wayward son
            There'll be peace when you are done
            Lay your weary head to rest
            Don't you cry no more
            No!
            Carry on, you will always remember
            Carry on, none can equal the splendor
            Now your life's no longer empty
            Surely heaven waits for you
            Carry on, my wayward son
            There'll be peace when you are done
            Lay your weary head to rest
            Don't you cry (don't you cry no more)">Don't you cry no more.</abbr></h1></li>
